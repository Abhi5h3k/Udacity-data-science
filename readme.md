# Data from a Developer Survey Analyzed

## A Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Project

The following inquiries will be addressed by this project's analysis of the data from the Stack Overflow Developer Survey:

1. Which nation offers developers the highest wages?
2. Which nation's developers are most satisfied with their jobs and careers?
3. Do hobbyist developers who code typically have more formal education, such a master's degree?

## requirements
1. Libraries Pandas is utilised for data analysis and modification.
2. NumPy: A Python library for numerical computing.
3. For data visualisation, use Matplotlib.

## What Motivates the Project
The goal of this research was to examine the results of the Stack Overflow Developer Survey and learn more about the health of the global software development market. We may comprehend a variety of trends and patterns among developers by studying the data, including those related to their pay, work satisfaction, and educational attainment, among other things.

## Data used
*survey_results_public.csv* is the primary data file for the 2017 Stack Overflow Developer Survey.

## solution
solution.ipynb: The code used to analyse the data from the Stack Overflow Developer Survey is available in this Jupyter notebook.

##Summary of Findings
1. The Virgin Islands (USA) , Bermuda, and U.S. Minor Outlying Islands are the nations that offer the best salaries for developers.
2. Libya, followed by Macau and Angola, is the nation where developers are most satisfied with their jobs and careers.
3. Developers who programme as a hobby  are competitively less to hold master's degrees.
