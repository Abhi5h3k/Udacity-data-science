# Analyzing Global Software Development Trends: Insights from the Stack Overflow Developer Survey

BLOG : https://udacity-datascience.blogspot.com/2023/04/findings-from-stack-overflow-developer.html



##Project Summary
In order to better understand the worldwide software development market, we examined data from the Stack Overflow Developer Survey for this research. The poll inquired about the wages, levels of job satisfaction, and educational backgrounds of developers from around the world. For data analysis and modification, we used the Pandas and NumPy libraries, and for data visualisation, we used the Matplotlib package.

##Business Knowledge
This project's objective was to analyse the results of the Stack Overflow Developer Survey in order to comprehend the state of the worldwide software development market. We sought to provide answers to issues like which nations pay its developers the greatest salaries and which nations have the most content creators. We intended to find trends and patterns in the data through analysis that would shed light on the market.

##Understanding Data
The 2017 Stack Overflow Developer Survey, a file that is part of the repository, serves as the project's main source of data. This file includes data on developers' earnings, happiness with their jobs, educational backgrounds, and other demographic details. To load and examine the data, we utilised the Pandas package, and to perform numerical computations, we used NumPy.

##Preparation of Data
By eliminating missing values and controlling outliers, we cleaned the data. In order to make the variables better suited for analysis, we also standardised them. These operations were completed using Pandas, and the cleaned data was then saved to a new CSV file for additional analysis.

##Analysis of Data
The data was analysed using a variety of techniques, such as summary statistics, data visualisations. To visualise the data, we used Matplotlib to produce bar charts and pie plots. For the purpose of finding patterns and trends in the data.

##Results and Assessment
The Virgin Islands (USA), Bermuda, and the U.S. Minor Outlying Islands are the locations with the highest developer wages, according to our data. The nations where developers are happiest with their employment and careers are Libya, Macau, and Angola. Further research revealed that master's degrees are less common among amateur developers.

Overall, our investigation offers insightful knowledge into the world market for software development. Our findings can be utilised to guide future industry research and business decisions. We anticipate that this project will be a helpful tool for anyone curious about the state of software development globally.

## A Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Project

The following inquiries will be addressed by this project's analysis of the data from the Stack Overflow Developer Survey:

1. Which nation offers developers the highest wages?
2. Which nation's developers are most satisfied with their jobs and careers?
3. Do hobbyist developers who code typically have more formal education, such a master's degree?

## requirements
1. Libraries Pandas is utilised for data analysis and modification.
2. NumPy: A Python library for numerical computing.
3. For data visualisation, use Matplotlib.

## What Motivates the Project
The goal of this research was to examine the results of the Stack Overflow Developer Survey and learn more about the health of the global software development market. We may comprehend a variety of trends and patterns among developers by studying the data, including those related to their pay, work satisfaction, and educational attainment, among other things.

## Data used
*survey_results_public.csv* is the primary data file for the 2017 Stack Overflow Developer Survey.

## solution
solution.ipynb: The code used to analyse the data from the Stack Overflow Developer Survey is available in this Jupyter notebook.

##Summary of Findings
1. The Virgin Islands (USA) , Bermuda, and U.S. Minor Outlying Islands are the nations that offer the best salaries for developers.
2. Libya, followed by Macau and Angola, is the nation where developers are most satisfied with their jobs and careers.

3. Developers who programme as a hobby  are competitively less to hold master's degrees.
